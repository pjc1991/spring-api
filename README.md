# Spring API Sample

YOU DON'T HAVE TO ALL THE WORKS FROM THE BEGINNING

I personally made this, because I don't want to all the works from the beginning whenever I made something with Springboots, ORM.

## Now this has...

> H2 Database
> Gradle Set-up
> Hibernate Set-up

## I am gonna add...

> Basic CRUD using JPA
> Simple Board API
> Member API
> Administrator Function

## I'm not gonna add...

> Some front-end more than simple template(Thyme-leaf)
