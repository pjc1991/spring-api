# Spring API Sample (WIP)

YOU DON'T HAVE TO ALL THE WORKS FROM THE BEGINNING

I personally made this, because I don't want to all the works from the beginning whenever I made something with Springboots, ORM.

## Now this has...

* H2 Database
* Gradle Set-up
* Hibernate Set-up

## I am gonna add...

1. Basic CRUD using JPA
2. Simple Board API
3. Member API
4. Administrator Function

## I'm not gonna add...

* Some front-end more than simple template(Thyme-leaf)
